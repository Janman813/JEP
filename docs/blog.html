        <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
        <p>This is where you will find what I have done at my intership and how I grow within it. I may even post pictures or even post that I make for them.</p>
        <h2>February 3, 2023</h2>
        <p>During my beginning week of my internship I went to see the build FEED for the first time and had a PR meeting with Benton and three others. We talked about how we will be able to sponser the event happening on the 4th and how to get it out in such a short time. We managed to do it and got the word out enought for a successful night and lots of donations.</p>

        <p>For my internship so far I experienced a showing of a man called Eric Lennartson of his art. I have also been working on post and writing them out for Mr. Bainbridge to be posted on his LinkedIn post. I also got to interview an artist named Not√® Peter George. It was a nice interview and hope I can have more opertunities like this in the future. </p>
         <h2>February 17, 2023</h2>
        <p>For this week I Have been writing about FEED and how it is coming along from where it has started. I am trying to write in my own voice and introduce myself in the my article before the article is typed out. I like the idea of it but at the same time it makes me feel like I will say something wrong. Which is why I show Benton what I write before I decide it is good or not. I look at this as an assignment where I am doing research and am coming out with a 200-300 word essay, because you do not want to write a lot for people might not want to read the whole thing if it is to long. Meet With Benton about our first post and will be triny to post it this weekend if we come to terms on the the post.</p>
        <h2>February 24, 2023</h2>
        <p>This week I was still writing for FEED and got out my second LinkIn post. The first one seemed to go really well and I hope this one does the same. I wasn't given to much to do this week for reasons that the employer and I both know about, but he was very considerate and understanding.</p>
