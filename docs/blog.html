        <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
        <p>This is where you will find what I have done at my intership and how I grow within it. I
            may even post pictures or even post that I make for them.</p>
        <h2>February 3, 2023</h2>
        <p>During my beginning week of my internship I went to see the build FEED for the first time
            and had a PR meeting with Benton and three others. We talked about how we will be able
            to sponser the event happening on the 4th and how to get it out in such a short time. We
            managed to do it and got the word out enought for a successful night and lots of
            donations.</p>
        <h2>February 10, 2023</h2>
        <p>For my internship so far I experienced a showing of a man called Eric Lennartson of his
            art. I have also been working on post and writing them out for Mr. Bainbridge to be
            posted on his LinkedIn post. I also got to interview an artist named Notè Peter George.
            It was a nice interview and hope I can have more opertunities like this in the future. </p>
        <h2>February 17, 2023</h2>
        <p>For this week I Have been writing about FEED and how it is coming along from where it has
            started. I am trying to write in my own voice and introduce myself in the my article
            before the article is typed out. I like the idea of it but at the same time it makes me
            feel like I will say something wrong. Which is why I show Benton what I write before I
            decide it is good or not. I look at this as an assignment where I am doing research and
            am coming out with a 200-300 word essay, because you do not want to write a lot for
            people might not want to read the whole thing if it is to long. Meet With Benton about
            our first post and will be triny to post it this weekend if we come to terms on the the
            post.</p>
        <h2>February 24, 2023</h2>
        <p>This week I was still writing for FEED and got out my second LinkIn post. The first one
            seemed to go really well and I hope this one does the same. I wasn't given to much to do
            this week for reasons that the employer and I both know about, but he was very
            considerate and understanding.</p>
        <h2>March 3, 2023</h2>
        <p>I started to write a post about Notè Peter George and his self portrait. I wanted to make
            it great and let reads know how I percieve it in a way that was not told in the video I
            was given. His self-portrait is something I would think about because what you create is
            a part of you and so incorporating that into his portrait made me intrigued. Also the
            color choices he choose makes it easy for people that are color blind to still enjoy and
            know what he is doing. I was also present during the Roland Slade Artist Talk and am now
            working on a post for his artist talk.</p>
        <h2>March 10, 2023</h2>
        <p>During this week it was spring break and I helped out around FEED. I worked more on my
            article and for Notè Peter George and had to wait for Roland Slades video to be edit by
            another intern. I wanted to use the video to help write the post well and be more
            informed. I was there but hearing and seeing it again you get another perspective which
            is what I wanted. </p>
        <h2>March 17, 2023</h2>
        <p>This week I helped set up new displays and got started on the Roland Slade post. I setup
            two tvs that one now shows Notè Peter George's art and another that shows a peicce that
            has been there. We also made the post on <i>Notè the Ego</i> on LinkedIn, now that we
            are showing another one of his pieces I was asked to write about that one to let people
            know we have a new piece.</p>
        <h2>March 24, 2023</h2>
        <p>For this week I worked on finishing and posting the Roldand Slade LinkedIn post. Since
            this was a post about an Artist talk and had a video to back it up I did not know how to
            go about it. I wanted something that explained but not to much so they would want to go
            watch the video and chime in the comment section to ask their own questions and see
            their own concerns.</p>
        <h2>March 31, 2023</h2>
        <p>This week I helped out a friendly face around FEED her name is Jayna take photos and
            videos of a poetry book she is self publishing. I am excited to see how they turned out
            and will be getting an interview to ask her more questions. What she had told me about
            the book made me want to buy my own and see all the poems she wrote.</p>
        <h2>April 7, 2023</h2>
        <p>This week for the internship I got to meet Notè Peter George for the first time face to
            face. Notè is the artist of residence all through April and is setting up his artwork to
            display at FEED. He even has a special installment that he is testing out at FEED. I
            came in on monday to help him figure out what projectors he should use and helped him
            figure out how he should display his art around the building. This is a great
            oppurtunity for everyone to see what FEED is wanting to turn into at the end of the day,
            because this is a space for anyone to come look and see what is Media Art. </p>
        <h2>April 14, 2023</h2>
        <p>This week I made extra time for Notè. to help him set up and to help him go buy things at
            lowes along with that I finally finished my interview with Jayna. I am very excited
            about this post on her book because it is something she has worked on for so long that
            it is her. Also, with Notè here we got Benton to agree to start an instagram page for
            FEED that I will be helping someone else with.</p>
        <h2>April 21, 2023</h2>
        <p>For this week I helped Notè get around and finish up painting these pools for his
            artwork. I have also been working on two different articles.</p>
        <h2>April 28, 2023</h2>
        <p>For the last week I helped Notè with a few things. One thing that we helped Notè with was
            set up a TV for him to display one of his pieces of art in the main room. Then we made a
            scuplture out of styrofoam from the tv box which was fun. We also gave him a few ideas
            on what he could do with it with his art show.</p>
