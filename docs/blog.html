        <p>This is where you will find what I have done at my intership and how I grow within it. I may even post pictures or even post that I make for them.</p>

        <p>For my internship so far I experienced a showing of a man called Eric Lennartson of his art. I have also been working on post and writing them out for Mr. Bainbridge to be posted on his LinkedIn post. I also got to interview an artist named Not√® Peter George. It was a nice interview and hope I can have more opertunities like this in the future. </p>
