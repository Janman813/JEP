            <p class="indent">Hello my name is Janet Pituch and this is my Website! This was made
                all in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Learning HTML and JavaScript has been a great
                experience and I hope you enjoy the contents of this site. I am making this site to
                be seen by others while at the same time using it to learn and teach myself. 
            <p class="indent">For example, the Random tab will lead you to my work in progress to
                see me testing out code. This is a fun area for me to put my notes and look back on
                my professional growth. Fun fact about the site when you see a random white word in
                a paragraph you can click on it and it will take you somewhere. Like try this link
                to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janetpituch/" target="blank">LinkedIn</a>.
                This will bring you to my LinkedIn page. 
            <p class="indent">The blog page helped me explain and show how my internship went and
                what I have experienced. This internship was completed under the owner of <a
                    href="https://feed.art/" target="blank">FEED Media Art Center</a> with the
                intension of me using my skills to help the company branch out. I worked on their
                LinkedIn platform and am thankful to have had this experience.</p>
