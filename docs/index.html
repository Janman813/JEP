        <p class="indent">Hello my name is Janet Pituch and this is my Website! This is a websit
            made all in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have enjoyed HTML and JavaScript very much and
            hope you enjoy seeing everything this site has to offer and show you. I would just like
            to point out this is not professional. I am making this cite to be seen by others but at
            the same time using it to learn and teach myself.</p>
        <p class="indent">For example the Random tab will lead you to my work in progress to
            learning how all this code works. Plus it is a fun little area for me to put my notes
            and look back on when I get older. I would rather write notes and show the progress then
            not. I feel it may help someone else someday and it will help me improve.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="indent">The blog page is for how my internship is going and what I have
            experienced. This internship is being done under the owner of FEED and how he can reach
            out and spread the companies name. I will be working on his LinkedIn platform and
            hopefully help him expand to more places.</p>
