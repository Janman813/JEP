                        animated it to make their tails wag and the sun in the background move down.

                        choose to use my families shop and explain the major events that had happen

                        make soemthing he would like in realation to the song. When creating this I
                        started out silent to bring attention to what the charater was doing. This
                        video means a lot to me even though I was really busy my friends came and
                        gave me a helping hand to complete and finish this video. I wanted this
                        video to be special for my friend that allowed me to use his original song
                        and for the friends that had helped me. </p>
