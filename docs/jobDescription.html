        <h2>Reason for this page</h2>
        <p>I made this page to inform potential employers on my previous job experiences. I myself
            have a hard time on the spot remembering everything that I have done for a company and
            thought writing it down would be helpful. So, I wrote it down where everyone can see it
            and read for themselves. I like to think of this page like a blog of all the jobs I have
            worked and how I have felt within the job. I want to look back at this and remember
            where I started and where I will end. It is my own like documentation of my own job
            history. I put a link on the photos for you to check out links to the places I have
            worked.</p>
        <h3>PARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION | 07/2021 to 06/2023</h3>
        <p class="indent1">At Parker Hannifin I worked in assembly at first. While working in
            assembly I followed rules, looked at materials/blueprints when needed, and
            positioned/algined components and parts. I enjoy my time there and the people are great.
            Everyone is friendly and helps each other when needed. Assembly taught me that hard work
            pays off and even if the job is not the greatest the people make it better.</p>

        <p class="indent1">As an HR Intern I would do a lot. I would Organize files from employee
            personal files to terminated files. I would organize files within the shared community
            folder on the cloud to make sure everything was up to date. I would edit the kiosk to
            inform employee's about new and upcoming events or make sign up sheets for particular
            events. I also made a prize for the workers when they had their own chili cook off.</p>
        <p class="indent1">Parker Hannifin is a huge corporation with buildings all over. The branch
            I worked for there was only four in the united states. This one in my home town was
            small and had two different locations. With the size of the company everyone knew
            everyone, it felt like one big family. Like any family we had our own issues and we
            would find people or go to the people that knew hoe to fix the issue. It is nice to work
            for a company like that because it feels more inviting. Working here while in college
            was probably the best thing for me. This company gave me an experience I may never of
            had anywhere else. If I had worked in a bigger company I wouldn't of had the same
            experience getting to know and getting to meet everyone. </p>

        <figure><a href="https://feed.art/"><img class="img2" width="270px" length="290px" src="Images/FEEDlogo.jpeg"/></a></figure>
        <p class="indent1">At Feed Media Art Center I did a lot. When I took this internship I
            thought I was going to figure out what I was going to do with me life. I thought this
            was going to help me understand my major way better because it is so all over the place.
            Yet, it did not. Do not get me wrong you can read on my blog about some of the stuff
            that had happen there and my experience, but did not help me prepare for my future
            sadly. It just helped me write about what is happening and research more on things. I
            learned to collaborate with artist of residency the one I worked with the most was Notè
            Peter George. For any more details on my time at <a href="blog.html">FEED</a> take a
            look at my blog.</p>
        <p class="indent1">Working with Notè Peter George was an interesting experience. He was a
            very friendly person and was great to talk to about art with. Notè would talk to me
            about his art and show me what he has been working on and what his vision was it was
            great! I enjoyed every part of it. One day I think it was like the last day I was
            messing with this styrafoam from a tv box and setting it up like an art sculpture. Notè
            saw and was intriged by it and started experimenting with us. it was great to help him
            make and invision something that others would have over looked. I also got to know Notè
            by taking him to places to get supplies and helping him with setting up which was
            nice.</p>
        <h3>SHOE CARNIVAL | 06/2020 to 06/2022</h3>
        <p class="indent1">Shoe Carnival was my second job I started around when the covid
            restrictions were being lifted. I heard about this job from a friend that had been
            working there for a while and then she gave me a recommendation there. It was a fresh
            start after working at TJ's and a new experience that I never thought I would work in
            retail.</p>
        <p class="indent1">At shoe carnival I was responsible for stocking and running aisles, run
            the cash regester, and take care of the sock wall with the purse wall. I went through a
            remodel with shoe carnival working late nights to help put the store back together and
            cleaning up as the workers remodling were working. During the remodel everyone was
            stressed and everyone was under a lot of pressure to get everything just right. We had
            two or three weeks that everything had to be back up and running but there were late
            materials which had to be installed after we re-opened the store. It made working there
            a little crazy but I was able to make it through with the help of my coworkers.</p>
        <p class="indent1">Working at Shoe Carnival taught me to speak to people and listen closely
            to what a person actually needs. My favorite memory working there was this man came in
            looking for a pair of shoe for his sister who is a nurse. First I had recommeneded him
            Crocs. Reason for recommending them is he told me she was a nurse and most nurses that
            came in were looking for Crocs. He said no I really want to get her a tennis shoe and
            croc made a tennis shoe and I showed him those and he was a tad bit interested. Yet, he
            ended up leaving to get his sisters opinion. He came back maybe two weeks later and told
            me I gave him a good recommendation and that his sister actually had those shoes
            already. He also mentioned next time that he came in he better see me wearing them to
            give him my honest and genuine opinion.</p>
        <p class="indent1">I was sad to leave Shoe Carnival at first but at the same time it was
            good for my health. I was working two jobs and wasn't getting enough sleep at night. I
            made my final decision on leaving when I almost fell asleep at the wheel. I liked
            working two jobs though it gave me more of a reason to get up and not waste my days
            away. This job gave me many hours and I was very thankful for that I was very Thankful
            for my General Manager Misty Tucker at the time as well. She tried her best to make
            things work for me and for that I will always be thankful for.</p>
        <h3>TJ's Ice Cream Palace | 01/2016 to 01/2018</h3>
        <p class="indent1">Oh TJ's what a fun place to work. It was a summer job that took up my
            time and with that it will always have a special place in my heart since it is closed.
            This was my first job and I worked for a lady name Pat Anthony. I was a cashier, food
            cook, and even manager for a day (it went well except on costumer didn't like how young
            I was). Working this job helped me learn the joy of multitasking because I had to juggle
            work and marching band at the same time and in the kitchen you might have to be cooking
            more then one order. This job set me up more so then school in my opinion to juggle a
            school life, work life, and a social life. The people I worked with were great probably
            the one job that hhad the least amount of drama you could imagine. I have to say though
            I feel somedays I had only gotten the job because of my brother and that he had worked
            there in high school before me, but Pat proved me wrong the next year when she asked me
            to come back and we worked out more of a deal with my marching band schedule. We had
            moments where we butt heads over it because if you had done marching band you know that
            takes up a lot of your time.</p>
        <p class="indent1">Pat once told me one of her favorite qualities of me was my patience and
            how I can handle when a new person just starting would make mistake after mistake. So,
            when someone new was just hired I would work that shift and she would tell me I will be
            training them. I tried my hardest to teach them as well as I could which I did but they
            would make little mistakes and I would show them how to fix them or they willl forget
            something and ask me real quick what it was. I do not like discouraging someone for what
            they are doing I like them to try it and come back to me to make sure it is correct
            especially for food orders. We had a girl that started around the saem time I did and
            would get food orders wrong and could not understand what she was doing worng. We would
            tell her what she did wrong but continue to do as she wished because she thought this is
            how it should be. Let's just say she did not last that long at TJ's sadly due to this,
            so when I was put to train someone I would make sure it was correct and that they were
            doing it right for maybe a week and a half after I let them go on their way.</p>
